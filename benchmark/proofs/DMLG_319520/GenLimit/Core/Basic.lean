# Language generation in the limit: basic definitions

This file fixes a countable universe `ℕ` and an indexed family of languages.
The family is indexed, rather than represented as a set of sets, because the
Kleinberg--Mullainathan algorithm depends on the enumeration order and permits
repeated languages.

/- AUDIT NOTE: The paper permits an arbitrary countable universe. This
development fixes that universe as `ℕ`, following the enumeration used in
Section 5, and does not currently provide a transport theorem from an arbitrary
countable type. -/
